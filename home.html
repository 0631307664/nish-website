        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            When I was 12, my mum was hospitalized for several months, leaving me to take over the household responsibilities. At that time, I had two older brothers—one of whom was mentally and physically challenged—and a younger sister. My dad worked long hours, and as is typical in a patriarchal brown family, it fell to me, the older daughter, to manage the home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our family lived during apartheid, a time when segregation shaped many of our experiences. My dad, who was Indian, had a great love for curries and Indian food, which is why my mum, who was Black, had to learn how to cook Indian dishes. Fortunately, my mum was an excellent seamstress and a very creative person, so learning how to cook Indian food came naturally to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            With my mum in the hospital, I quickly had to step in, managing the household and cooking meals for the family. This was when my love for cooking first took root. Being mixed-race, I didn’t limit myself to just Indian food. I began to experiment with a variety of cuisines, combining influences from both sides of my heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mum, ever the nurturing force, bought me my first recipe book titled <em>Indian's Delight</em>. It was in this book that I learned the basic principles of cooking. From there, I began to buy cooking and home magazines with whatever pocket money I could gather. Over time, cooking became more than just a necessity; it became a passion that stayed with me throughout my life.
        </p>

        <h2>My Passion for Cooking and Family</h2>
        <p>
            As I grew into adulthood and became a mother, I carried my love for cooking into my own family life. I never bought a birthday cake for any of my children—I baked all their birthday cakes. Now, as adults with families of their own, my children often tease me about how I never bought cookies or sweets. All their treats were homemade, made with love and care in the same spirit that had been passed down to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cooking became a way for me to nurture my family and continue the legacy of my mother’s creative spirit. Every meal, every treat, and every cake I baked was infused with the lessons I had learned growing up—a blend of love, patience, and creativity.
