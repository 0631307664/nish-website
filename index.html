        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Nish Ramphal, and I’m so glad you’re here. Like many women, my life was shaped by what I observed growing up. As a brown woman from a third-world country, I lived in a society where patriarchy was the norm, and the roles of women were often confined to home, work, and church. We weren’t taught how to be godly women or how to live out the abundant life God intended for us. Instead, we learned by observing what was around us—patterns that often reflected struggle, limitation, and compromise.</p>
        <p>But God had more in store for me—and for you too. Through the trials and triumphs of my life, I learned to break free from those limitations. I’ve walked a journey of unlearning unhealthy patterns, embracing spiritual growth, and stepping into the freedom of living as the woman God created me to be. It wasn’t easy, but it was transformative.</p>
        <p>Today, I see this season of life as a powerful opportunity to help women over 50 rise above the constraints we grew up with. My mission is to inspire and empower women to live independent, healthy, and spiritually grounded lives. This isn’t just about us—it’s about becoming women of grace who teach and guide the next generation, as Titus 2:3-5 encourages us to do.</p>
        <p>I love people, and it’s my passion to teach and help women heal. I believe my calling is to help you take bold, giant steps to grow individually and move closer to God. Together, we can break free from the past, sharpen our tools, and step confidently into a future filled with purpose and grace.</p>
        <p>Let’s rise up, embrace this calling, and create a legacy of strength, faith, and love. Your best days are not behind you—they are ahead. And I’m here to walk this journey with you.</p>
